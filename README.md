# 🏡 Real Estate Data Analysis using Web Scraping & EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on collecting real estate property data using web scraping techniques and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to understand pricing patterns and market trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract property data from online platforms
- Convert unstructured web data into structured format
- Clean and preprocess dataset
- Perform Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis
- Generate insights using visualizations

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset Details
- Total Records: ~1500
- Columns: platform, title, price, area_sqft, location, builder, property_type, city, scrape_date
- Derived Columns: price_per_sqft, budget_category

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed
### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Price Distribution
- Area Distribution
- Property Type Distribution
- Budget Segmentation

### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- Area vs Price
- Location vs Avg Price
- Property Type vs Price

### 🔹 Multivariate Analysis
- Area, Price & Location Interaction
- Correlation Heatmap

---

## 🔥 Key Insights
- Price has strong positive correlation with area (0.62).
- Price per sqft is influenced more by location than size.
- Market is dominated by mid-range properties.
- Premium zones have higher unit pricing.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
The project demonstrates the complete data analytics lifecycle from data collection to insight generation using Python.
